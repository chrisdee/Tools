       are now done via the UI.
    3. "Favorite services" can now be added via the configuration window.  These services will
       appear in the dropdown options whenever you add a web service
    4. The config file is optional. However, to further customize the tool the items below can be
       configured
      
            
               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
               <configuration>
                  <appSettings>
                    <add key="ShowSplash" value="3"/> <!-- set to zero or negative number to disable splash-->
                    
                    <!-- UI settings--> 
                    <add key="GradientHighColor" value="Window"/>
                    <add key="GradientLowColor" value="GradientActiveCaption"/>
                    <add key="GradientRenderMode" value="Glass"/> <!-- Glass, Gradient or Flat -->
                  </appSettings>
               </configuration>


  FIXES:

    1. Issue 2398 : Handling of abstract/polymorphic types. A dropdown of allowed types will be shown
       whenever a polymorphic type is encountered.
    2. Object editor in "Tree View" now shows up for newly opened tabd.
    3. Exception is no longer raised when a default soap cannot be created. A warning is instead
       logged in the log window
    4. Fixed the error below.
      
       Exception occurs when
          step 1. open method in a new tab
          step 2. Invoke method
          step 3. switch to QuickEdit tab and select the same method. This triggers an exception.

Release notes Storm_r1.1  Spet 29, 2008
------------------------

  Changes :
  =========
    1. Added multiple tab support.
          * Right-click on a web method -> Open in new tab
    2. Added Test case Editor
          * Right-click on a test case -> Run/Edit
          * Test input and expected response are editable.
          * The actual response can be "Promoted" into the Expected response.
    3. Moved UI config out of the config file into Configuration Main menu      
          * COnfiguration is now divided into 2 tabs, Service and User Interface. 
            For the moment, the User Interface tab contains 2 fields
              a. Color raw soap -> Toogle to enable/disable syntax highlighting of
                 the soap message in "Raw view".  This is checked by default but if you're working
                 with very large soap messages, uncheck this 
                 
              b. Show Detailed exception -> Toggle to enable/disable very detailed log exception
                 entries
              
    4. Added saving of UI settings are when the app is closed.  File is Storm.settings
    5. Added generation of default soap messages.  Web methods can now be invoked  from
       "Raw view" without having to invoke the web method 1st via Tree View
       
    6. Added saving of "Expected response"
    7. Added execution of test cases and automatic comparison of the actual and expected response.
       The 2 responsed are shown side-by-side and the differences highlighted.
    8. Added real-time syntax highlighting for raw soap messages.
    9. Added notification windows (fades in and out). (shown at the lower-right corner of the tool). 
    10. Added clearing of the logging window.
    
    11. Code changes brought about by the F# Sept 08 CTP release. (you'll now need VS 2008 to open the F# projects).
    
    12. Cleaner splash screen.
    
    13. Others..
    
    14. Added paypal "Donate" button (Click on the ABOUT menu button).  The donate link has been in the codeplex site 
        for a long time and Storm has been downloaded 3000+ times and yet there
        has been ZERO donations so far.  I wrote STORM out of genuine desire to help out my fellow
        developers but it was naive of me to assume i'd get something back.Anyway I hope someone
        out there will donate so that I can at least upgrade my 1G RAM Vista laptop.
    
  Fixes :
  ========
    1. fix for Issue 1464 : WCF Services with basicHttpBinding now supported
    2. fix for issue 2180 : ADDED NTLM and Proxy authentication to web service calls.  The values needed for these
         are all configurable from the Configurations menu or from the COnfiguration section (Lower right portion)
    3. fix for issue 2042 : Nullable fields now works as expected.  In addition, objects set to null (in Tree View) are 
       no longer sent with default values.
