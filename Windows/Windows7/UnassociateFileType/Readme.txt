Unassoc - Description
==========================

This utility helps you unassociate a file type quickly in your 
Windows Vista or Windows 7 PC. Windows 7 & Vista do not provide a GUI 
option to unassociate file types. That's the reason I wrote 
this simple tool.


Requirements
============

1. This utility requires administrative privileges to work correctly.
2. To be used in Windows® Vista and Windows® 7 systems only.
