Right-click anywhere in the results window above after running the query, then choose Copy to copy fieldnames to clipboard. 
This a simple method for gathering fieldnames for logs you may not be familiar with when writing your own queries.
For example, the fields below were gathered after running the above query:


Filename, RowNumber, DateTime, RequestId, MajorVersion, MinorVersion, BuildVersion, RevisionVersion, ClientRequestId, 
Protocol, UrlStem, ProtocolAction, AuthenticationType, IsAuthenticated, AuthenticatedUser, Organization, AnchorMailbox, 
UserAgent, ClientIpAddress, ServerHostName, HttpStatus, BackEndStatus, ErrorCode, Method, ProxyAction, TargetServer, 
TargetServerVersion, RoutingType, RoutingHint, BackEndCookie, ServerLocatorHost, ServerLocatorLatency, RequestBytes, 
ResponseBytes, TargetOutstandingRequests, AuthModulePerfContext, HttpPipelineLatency, CalculateTargetBackEndLatency, 
GlsLatencyBreakup, TotalGlsLatency, AccountForestLatencyBreakup, TotalAccountForestLatency, ResourceForestLatencyBreakup, 
TotalResourceForestLatency, ADLatency, ActivityContextLifeTime, ModuleToHandlerSwitching, FirstResponseByteReceived, 
ProxyTime, RequestHandlerLatency, HandlerToModuleSwitching, HttpProxyOverhead, RoutingLatency, NetworkLatency, 
BackendProcessingLatency, TotalRequestTime, UrlQuery, BackEndGenericInfo, GenericInfo, GenericErrors

^ Now that we know the field names we can use them to construct our own query:

SELECT TOP 500 FROM '[LOGFILEPATH]' 
WHERE TotalRequestTime &gt; 500
