The Sysinternals Troubleshooting Utilities have been rolled up into a single Suite of tools. This file contains the individual troubleshooting tools and help files. It does not contain non-troubleshooting tools like the BSOD Screen Saver or NotMyFault.
For more information about Sysinternals and these utilities, please visit the website - http://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals

The Suite is a bundling of the following selected Sysinternals Utilities:



AccessChk - AccessChk is a command-line tool for viewing the effective permissions on files, registry keys, services, processes, kernel objects, and more.

AccessEnum - This simple yet powerful security tool shows you who has what access to directories, files and Registry keys on your systems. Use it to find holes in your permissions.

AdExplorer - Active Directory Explorer is an advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer and editor.

AdInsight - An LDAP (Light-weight Directory Access Protocol) real-time monitoring tool aimed at troubleshooting Active Directory client applications.

AdRestore - Undelete Server 2003 Active Directory objects.

Autologon - Bypass password screen during logon.

Autoruns - See what programs are configured to startup automatically when your system boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list of Registry and file locations where applications can configure auto-start settings.

BgInfo - This fully-configurable program automatically generates desktop backgrounds that include important information about the system including IP addresses, computer name, network adapters, and more.

CacheSet - CacheSet is a program that allows you to control the Cache Manager's working set size using functions provided by NT. It's compatible with all versions of NT.

ClockRes - View the resolution of the system clock, which is also the maximum timer resolution.

Contig - Wish you could quickly defragment your frequently used files? Use Contig to optimize individual files, or to create new files that are contiguous.

Coreinfo - Coreinfo is a new command-line utility that shows you the mapping between logical processors and the physical processor, NUMA node, and socket on which they reside, as well as the cache’s assigned to each logical processor.

Ctrl2cap - This is a kernel-mode driver that demonstrates keyboard input filtering just above the keyboard class driver in order to turn caps-locks into control keys. Filtering at this level allows conversion and hiding of keys before NT even "sees" them. Ctrl2cap also shows how to use NtDisplayString() to print messages to the initialization blue-screen.

DebugView - Another first from Sysinternals: This program intercepts calls made to DbgPrint by device drivers and OutputDebugString made by Win32 programs. It allows for viewing and recording of debug session output on your local machine or across the Internet without an active debugger.

Desktops - This new utility enables you to create up to four virtual desktops and to use a tray interface or hotkeys to preview what’s on each desktop and easily switch between them.

Disk2vhd - Disk2vhd simplifies the migration of physical systems into virtual machines (p2v).

DiskExt - Display volume disk-mappings.

Diskmon - This utility captures all hard disk activity or acts like a software disk activity light in your system tray.

DiskView - Graphical disk sector utility.

Disk Usage (DU) - View disk usage by directory.

EFSDump - View information for encrypted files.

Handle - This handy command-line utility will show you what files are open by which processes, and much more.

PageDefrag - Defragment your paging files and Registry hives.

PendMoves - Enumerate the list of file rename and delete commands that will be executed the next boot.

PipeList - Displays the named pipes on your system, including the number of maximum instances and active instances for each pipe.

PortMon- Monitor serial and parallel port activity with this advanced monitoring tool. It knows about all standard serial and parallel IOCTLs and even shows you a portion of the data being sent and received. Version 3.x has powerful new UI enhancements and advanced filtering capabilities.

ProcDump - This new command-line utility is aimed at capturing process dumps of otherwise difficult to isolate and reproduce CPU spikes. It also serves as a general process dump creation utility and can also monitor and generate process dumps when a process has a hung window or unhandled exception.
